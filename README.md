# FTIR Pre-processing tools for R
This package intends to provide tools for preparing FTIR spectra for multivariate analysis, including:

- Baseline correction
  - WS-ALS
  - FWT
  - Rolling ball
  - air-PLS

- Noise filter:
  - Savitzki-Golay
  - Butterworth
  - Wavelet Denoising

- Noise analysis:
  - SNR estimation
  - Power Spectral Density

- Deconvolution and peak detection
  - Multi-resolution analysis
  - L1-regularized Least Squares
  - Fourier Self-deconvolution

# Status
This package is currently being developed, and not all features have been implemented.

Suggestions and contributions are welcome.
